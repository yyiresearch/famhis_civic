# Reconsidering the Relationship between Incarceration, Trust in the State, Community Engagement, and Civic Participation
*Abstract*<br/>Scholars have reached different conclusions about the relationship between carceral contact and community engagement and civic participation. We offer a theoretical account that aims to synthesize this work to argue that incarceration should depress trust in the state but may increase, decrease, or produce no substantial effect on community or civic engagement, leading to no overall average association. We use data from the Family History of Incarceration Survey (FamHIS), a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States (n=2,703) to conduct an expansive test of associations between direct (own) and indirect (family member) incarceration and trust in the state, civic participation, and community engagement. Our findings show that incarceration may not uniformly depress political and civic behaviors, on average. Further, they inform our understanding of seemingly divergent conclusions in prior research, underscoring potential variability of prosocial actions and their enabling and constraining conditions in the wake of carceral contact.

### Repository Summary and Setup
This repository contains the full suite of materials required to replicate analyses published in Yi, Enns, and Wildeman (2024). In order to replicate analyses, begin by ensuring that the required software have been installed (Stata, R/RStudio) and download materials (data, programming files) from this repository for analysis. Begin with the main overarching programming file, "0_yi-enns-wildeman.do" (Stata .do file), for instructions on how to set up the materials for analysis and for the order of analysis.
